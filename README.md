# Firebase App Android Info

![](https://firebase.google.com/_static/3260bec2e7/images/firebase/lockup.png)

Need to create your `google-services.json` file (Not use repository file because only available permissions for my computer).

To create this file and add project, go to https://console.firebase.google.com/?pli=1

Select the existing project (if you have created, otherwise we will have to create a) and `"Add firebase"` We take the chance.)

Use reference with steps needed to configure firebase on Android in https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup
